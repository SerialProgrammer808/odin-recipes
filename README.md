# RECIPES
## BACKGROUND
As a person who loves to create and a student studying computer science, I have taken it upon myself to learn web development through The Odin Project. This is the first project of the curriculum and in this project I will create a webpage to display my favorite websites using HTML

## OVERVIEW
The structure of this project is as follows:
- A main directory called "odin-recipes" with an index.html file
- A "recipes" directory within the "odin-recipes" directory
- Three recipe files in the recipes directory each containing a description, ingredients, steps, images, and a link to the home page "index.html"
- Links to each recipe in the "index.html" file


## TOOLS
This project utilizes the following:
- HTML
- Git
- Github
- The mac terminal/Z shell
