        <h2 class="recipe-subheader">Description</h2>
            <p class="recipe-text">Tzatziki is a salted yogurt and cucumber dip that’s made of strained yogurt, 
                shredded cucumber, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, salt, and herbs. Authentic 
                Greek tzatziki is most often made with sheep or goat yogurt, but my tzatziki 
                recipe calls for regular full-fat Greek yogurt. It’s easier to find in the store,
                 and it still has the creamy, thick consistency you want in tzatziki sauce. 
                 Along with the other traditional ingredients, I stir in fresh mint and dill 
                 for a bright, summery finish.</p>
